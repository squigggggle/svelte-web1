# ID512 2023 Website
## Purpose
This website shows contains pictures of my cats, and a random cat image page. 
## Technology used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* SvelteKit
## Bugs
- Random cat image fetch sometimes fetches two images, shows the first one briefly and gets replaced by the second one
- Black fade between loading pages doesn't appear over the page content or hide the scroll bar, so it is possible to see the current page after clicking a link
## Roadmap
- Add a loading indicator on the random cat page to indicate something is happening when the button is pressed
- Fix the loading fade so that it covers the entire screen
