## Purpose

## Technology used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* SvelteKit
## Bugs
- Random cat image fetch sometimes fetches two images, shows the first one briefly and gets replaced by the second one
- Black fade between loading pages doesn't appear over the page content or hide the scroll bar, so it is possible to see the current page after clicking a link
## Roadmap
- Add a loading indicator on the random cat page to indicate something is happening when the button is pressed
